#Welcome!
The Embedded Machine Learning club at NC State raises awareness about Machine Learning (ML) by conducting outreach and to advance member knowledge and skills in ML with internal education. It provides members a hands-on opportunity to gain technical and leadership skills, increase professional development, build career networks, and propel internship search, and provides impactful ML solutions to community partners including research groups and other club organizations in addition to hosting and participating in ML-related competitions. Currently we are working towards creating a autonomous race car for the F1Tenth competitions!
